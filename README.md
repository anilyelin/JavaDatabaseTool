# JavaFX JavaDatabaseTool

First experminent with the JavaFX framework to get a working prototype for a mysql client.
The use case is an employee managing tool where you can create employees, manage them etc. 
Whole project is based on the model-view-controller pattern.


This project is a maven project, to build this project you have to simply navigate into to source folder
and run the command 

```bash
mvn package
```

in the terminal assumed you have already installed maven.
